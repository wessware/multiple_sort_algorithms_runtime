## Multiple Sort Algorithms Runtime

In this program, I created a number of sorting algorithms and computed their separate runtimes and complexity to try and determine which one amongst took the shortest time to sort through a list of values (n).

# The Algorithms

Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Bubble Sort
Two way Merge Sort
Hybrid Merge Sort
Three way Merge Sort
