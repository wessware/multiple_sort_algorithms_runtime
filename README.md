## Multiple Sort Algorithms Runtime

In this program, I created a number of sorting algorithms and computed their separate runtimes and complexity to try and determine which one amongst them executed in the shortest time to sort through a list of values (n).

# The Algorithms

<ul>
<li>Insertion Sort</li>
<li>Selection Sort</li>
<li>Bubble Sort</li>
<li>Two way Merge Sort</li>
<li>Hybrid Merge Sort</li>
<li>Three way Merge Sort</li>
